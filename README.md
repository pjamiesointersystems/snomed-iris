# sct

A local-first SNOMED CT toolchain that's 10-100x faster than IHTSDO Snowstorm. One binary — from raw RF2 release to NDJSON, then SQL, Parquet, Markdown, TUI, GUI, graphs and MCP/LLM tool use. All on your machine, no network calls, REST APIs, or external servers required.

This is very much a work in progress, but it's ready to use and I would very much like feedback on how it performs for you.

                         sct semantic ──▶ cosine similarity search (requires Ollama)

sct info  <file>              inspect any artefact for more information
sct diff  --old <f> --new <f> compare two NDJSON releases (untested)
sct gui                       browser-based UI served over localhost
                              with graph visualisation and point-and-click exploration.
sct tui                       experimental terminal UI to explore concepts and relationships.
sct completions <shell>       generate shell completions (optional)
```

The NDJSON artefact at the centre is a stable, versionable, greppable file. All other outputs are derived from it and can be regenerated at any time.

## Why is this needed?

`sct` joins the relatively incomprehensible RF2 files into a single NDJSON artefact. For the UK Monolith Edition this NDJSON file is over 1Gb but it was still possible to load into VSCode to get a feel for the data structure, which is something that is impossible with the original RF2 files. This also means you can use standard tools like `jq` or `ripgrep` to query the data without needing a custom server or API.

SNOMED CT is distributed as RF2 — a set of tab-separated files that require joining across multiple tables to get anything useful. The entire healthcare industry relies on remote terminology servers for this, with the overhead of network calls and REST APIs. `sct` performs the join once creating an NDJSON artefact, and produces standard files you can query locally with `sqlite3`, `duckdb`, `jq`, `ripgrep`, or an LLM. No server, no API key, no network.

## Speed comparison

| Operation | `sct` + SQLite | Snowstorm Lite | `sct` speedup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Import - Clinical Edition | 22s | 209s | ~10x faster |
| Import - Full UK Monolith | ~57s | Failed (OOM)* | ∞ |
| Single concept lookup (SCTID) | 6ms | 491ms | ~80x faster |
| Free-text search (10 results) | 2ms | 202ms | ~100x faster |

> * Snowstorm Lite running in Docker with 24Gb of Java heap allocation ran out of memory on the full UK Monolith, which has 831k concepts. `sct` handled it in under a minute.

For more detailed benchmarks, see [docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md). Feel free to run the benchmarks yourself and share your results, perhaps as an Issue.

## Installation

Prebuilt binaries are published for Linux (x86_64, aarch64), macOS (Apple Silicon, Intel), and Windows (x86_64) on every release, with SHA-256 checksums you can verify against the `SHA256SUMS` file on the [Releases page](https://github.com/pacharanero/sct/releases).

### Shell one-liners

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pacharanero/sct/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pacharanero/sct/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Both installers auto-detect your OS and architecture, download the matching binary, verify its SHA-256 checksum against the published `SHA256SUMS`, and install to `~/.local/bin` (macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\sct\bin` (Windows). Override the destination with `SCT_INSTALL_DIR`, or pin a specific version with `SCT_VERSION=v0.3.9`.

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```bash
brew tap pacharanero/sct
brew install sct
```

### Scoop (Windows)

```powershell
scoop bucket add sct https://github.com/pacharanero/scoop-sct
scoop install sct
```

### Cargo

If you already have a Rust toolchain (via [rustup](https://rustup.rs), stable 1.70+):

```bash
# Compile from crates.io
cargo install sct-rs
```

Or, if you have the [`cargo-binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) plugin installed (it is not bundled with `cargo` itself), grab a prebuilt binary instead of compiling from source:

```bash
# One-time: install the binstall plugin (or follow the one-liner installers in its README)
cargo install cargo-binstall

# Then install sct without compilation
cargo binstall sct-rs
```

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pacharanero/sct
cd sct
cargo install --path .                   # default build
cargo install --path . --features tui    # with terminal UI
cargo install --path . --features gui    # with browser UI
cargo install --path . --features full   # both
```

| Feature | What it adds | Extra dependencies |
|---|---|---|
| (default) | All non-interactive subcommands | — |
| `tui` | Keyboard-driven terminal UI (`sct tui`) | `ratatui`, `crossterm` |
| `gui` | Browser-based graph UI (`sct gui`) | `axum`, `tokio`, `open` |
| `full` | Both of the above | all of the above |

### Manual download

Grab the appropriate archive from the [Releases page](https://github.com/pacharanero/sct/releases), verify its SHA-256 against `SHA256SUMS`, extract, and drop `sct` somewhere on your `PATH`.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Download a distribution of SNOMED CT
#    UK:            https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/ → Monolith Edition, RF2: Snapshot
#                   (free under NHS England national licence — access is immediate)
#                   NB: You need to Subscribe to a release before you can see the Download option 🤯
#    International: https://mlds.ihtsdotools.org/ (allow up to a week for approval)

# 2. Convert RF2 → NDJSON (~10s for 831k concepts)
#    Pass the .zip directly — no manual extraction needed
sct ndjson --rf2 SnomedCT_MonolithRF2_PRODUCTION_20260311T120000Z.zip
# ✓  831,487 concepts written → snomedct-monolithrf2-production-20260311t120000z.ndjson

# 3. Load into SQLite with FTS5
sct sqlite --input snomedct-monolithrf2-production-20260311t120000z.ndjson

# 4. Query with standard tools — no custom binary needed
sqlite3 snomed.db \
  "SELECT id, preferred_term FROM concepts_fts WHERE concepts_fts MATCH 'heart attack' LIMIT 5"

# 5. Start the MCP server for Claude Desktop
sct mcp --db snomed.db
```

UK users can automate steps 1–3 with a single command once the [TRUD API integration](docs/commands/trud.md) is set up:

```bash
sct trud download --edition uk_monolith --pipeline
```

## Feedback

Please try it out and let me know how it performs for you, especially if you have a use case that isn't well supported by the current subcommands. Open an [Issue](https://github.com/pacharanero/sct/issues) for anything you want to report, from bugs to feature requests to general feedback.

## Development

A [devcontainer](https://containers.dev/) configuration is included in `.devcontainer/`. Open the project in VS Code and select "Reopen in Container" to get a ready-to-go environment with Rust, `sqlite3`, `duckdb`, `jq`, and `ripgrep` pre-installed. Also included is `python3` and Ollama, for working with the embeddings and semantic search features.

Store SNOMED data files (zips, NDJSON, databases) in the `data-volume/` directory inside the container — it's backed by a Docker volume for faster I/O than the default bind mount.
